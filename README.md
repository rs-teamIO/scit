## Environment setup

### For Docker
1. Make sure Docker is up and running, and set the configuration to Linux containers.
2. Open `cmd` and navigate to the backend folder where `docker-compose.yml` is located
3. Start the containers using the `docker-compose up` command.

### General
1. Make sure eXist-db is running on port `8080`
	> `username: admin`
	
	> `password: [leave blank]`
2. Go to eXist dashboard and manually create a new collection named `scit` on path `db/apps`.
3. Upload the XML resources located in `resources/data` to the previously created collection
4. Make sure Apache Jena is running on port `3030`
	> `username: admin`
	
	> `password: admin`
5. Go to Jena dashboard and create a new persistent dataset named `scit`.

## Running the application

### Backend
Start it as a [Spring Boot application](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
> NOTE: For frontend to work properly, backend must run on port 8001

In case something doesn't work, make sure all the parameters in the `application.properties` file are configured properly.
### Frontend

```
npm install
```

```
#Compiles and hot-reloads for development
ng serve
```

Go to <http://localhost:4200> to use the application.
